# Textbased_Slot_Machine ðŸŽ°

Welcome to the Text-Based Slot Machine game! This is a Python project that allows users to deposit money, place bets on a slot machine, and try their luck at winning big. The game continues until the player decides to cash out or runs out of money.

Disclaimer** I do not support gambling here. We are not using any real money.

Features
âž¡Deposit System: Users can deposit an initial amount of money to start playing.
âž¡Betting: Place bets on one or more of the 3 available lines on the slot machine.
âž¡Slot Machine Spin: Spin the slot machine to generate random items on the different wheels.
âž¡Winning Calculation: If the user wins on any line, their bet is multiplied by the value of the line and added to their balance.
âž¡Continuous Play: The game continues until the user either cashes out or runs out of money.
